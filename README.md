# Automated Toll Road System Using GPS, Python & APIs

## Project Overview

The **Automated Toll Road System** is a smart solution designed to automate toll collection using GPS technology, Python programming, and external APIs. This system tracks vehicles in real-time to detect their entry and exit across toll zones, calculates toll charges based on distance traveled, and facilitates seamless electronic payments without stopping at toll booths.
