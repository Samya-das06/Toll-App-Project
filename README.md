# Automated Toll Road System Using GPS, Python & APIs

## Project Overview

The **Automated Toll Road System** is a smart solution designed to automate toll collection using GPS technology, Python programming, and external APIs. This system tracks vehicles in real-time to detect their entry and exit across toll zones, calculates toll charges based on distance traveled, and facilitates seamless electronic payments without stopping at toll booths.

## Features

- üöó **Real-time Vehicle Tracking:** Utilizes GPS data to monitor vehicle locations continuously.
- üõ£Ô∏è **Automated Toll Calculation:** Calculates tolls based on vehicle travel distance within predefined toll zones.
- üåê **API Integration:** Uses mapping/location APIs (e.g., Google Maps API) to define toll boundaries and validate positions.
- üíª **Python Backend:** Handles data processing, toll computation, and transaction management.
- üîî **User Notifications:** Sends automated email/SMS notifications for toll charges and payment confirmation.
- üí≥ **Secure Payment Integration:** Connects with payment gateways for smooth electronic toll payments.
